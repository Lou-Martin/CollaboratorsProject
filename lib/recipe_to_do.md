## 1. Describe the Problem

_Put or write the user story here. Add any clarifying notes you might have._

As a user
So that I can keep track of my tasks
I want to check if a text includes the string #TODO

## 2. Design the Function Signature

_Include the name of the function, its parameters, return value, and side effects._

Function name = to_do()

Parameters = takes  argument ()

Returns 


```python
# EXAMPLE

def to_do():
    """checks 

    Parameters: ()
        a something (eg "")

    Returns: (state the return value and its type)
        a something (eg [""])

    Side effects: (state any side effects)
        
    """
    pass # Test-driving means _not_ writing any code here yet.
```

## 3. Create Examples as Tests

_Make a list of examples of what the function will take and return._

```python
# EXAMPLE

to_do(sometext)
returns ""

to_do(sometext)
returns ""
```

_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._

## 4. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._

Ensure all test function names are unique, otherwise pytest will ignore them!
